# JavaScript: `javascripting` Study

1.  Install `javascripting` by running `npm install --global javascripting` from
    the command line interface.
1.  Run `javascripting` from the command line interface and follow the
    instructions
1.  Commit early and often as you work.
1.  Add your work to the `lib` directory.

## Working Instructions

-   Work in `strict` mode to allow use of `let` and `const` (`javascripting`'s
    instructions will instruct you to use `var`).
-   Use commit messages as your learning journal by making notes of challenges
    and what you have learned after completing each exercise. Try to write
    your commit messages with a subject line that is less than or equal to 50
    characters, a blank line, and then a body that is wrapped at 72 characters
    per line. ([example](https://github.com/jrhorn424/learnyounode/commit/5db673a16d4af82d3c5a80240edeb93b0e4dbd0c)).
-   Push the changes to GitHub so that future employers can get an idea of what
    your learning process (not to mention your tenacity!) is like.

## Response

As noted previously, **no response is required** for this study. Complete the
workshop at your own pace as a review tool for fundamental JavaScript.

If you wish, you may open an issue. Include any questions you still have, or any
topic you want to explore further in a 1on1 meeting.

If you do this, be sure to schedule your 1on1 with a consultant and link to your
response issue, which will serve as an agenda for the meeting.
